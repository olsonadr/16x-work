                                            1: You don't have a flower though... The wizard takes this as a great insult and incinerates you with a <purple>lighting bolt</purple>!

                    2: You draw your sword and prepare to fight, but you realize you're just a CS nerd and don't know how to use it. You start to notice how heavy your armour is. The <red>bridge troll</red> crushes you in one blow.

            3: You set off like the brilliant knight you are. You hike through the great valleys of New York, across the vast expanses of the endless woods, and set out over the rolling hills of New Jersey. Suddenly, you come across a beautiful <green>green flower</green>!
                Choice: Would you like to...
                    1. Take the <green>green flower</green> for your journey!

                        <for either preceding choice> After your surprisingly refreshing stroll through the rolling hills, you come to a small cottage out in the country-side of East-Russia. An maid is carving an impressive ice-sculpture outside the cottage.
                            Choice: Do you...
                                1. Give the maid the <green>green flower</green>.
                                2. Keep walking, it's YOUR <green>green flower</green> now!

                                1: You give the maid the flower, and she falls instantly in love with you. You get married and spend the rest of your life drinking Diet Sprite while your lovely wife supports you both with her fantastic ice-sculptures. You forget your quest quickly and enjoy the rest of your life.
                                    GAME OVER! You have found ending 5/7: 'Diet Knight'
                                2: And so you continue your journey, leaving the maid behind you, and eventually coming to the great mountain range of Thuud. You set out with a band of 6 onto the treacherous slopes. You try to pass through, but after 50 continuous minutes of climbing, you run out of energy and give up to die. You freeze and your body is never found.
