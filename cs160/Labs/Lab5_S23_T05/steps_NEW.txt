# Each line is an action you want Cozmo to make followed by a value needed for the movement.
#
# This step can be drive, turn, cube, or drop; followed by an argument of:
# 	drive,num: num is distance in mm to drive
# 	turn,num: num is degrees to turn (where counter-clockwise rotation is positive)
# 	cube,num: num is rotation of Cozmo's head. Always pass 0 for optimal searching.
# 	drop,num: num should always be passed as 0
#
# An example line is: "drive,500" to make Cozmo drive 500 mm forward.
#
# Steps:
cube,0
turn,-90
drive,400
turn,90
drive,200
